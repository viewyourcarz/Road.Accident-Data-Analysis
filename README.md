# Road.Accident-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize road accident data to identify trends, patterns and insights that can inform road safety initiatives and policies.

## Data Sources
Road Accident data: The primary dataset is used for analysis is the "road accident data.xlsx" containing the detailed information about the road accidents data classified by type of injury, type of vehicle involved in accident, type of road, type of geographical area, time of the day and road conditions.

## Tools

## Data Cleaning/ Preparation
In the initial phase I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Conditional Formatting - Deleted repeating entries
3. Handling of missing values
4. Data cleaning and formatting
5. Round off integers to 5 decimal places

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution and summary statistics
  1. What is the distribution of accident frequencies by day of the week?
  2. What are the most common types of accidents (e.g rear-end, head-on, pedestrain)?
  3. What is the average speed limit at accident locations?
  4. What is the distribution of accident severity (e.g fatal, injury, property, damage only)?

- Relationships and correlations
  1. Is there a relationship between speed limit annd accident frequency?
  2. Do accidents occur more frequently during certain times of the day (e.g rush hour)
  3. Is there a correlation between road type (e.g highway, urban, rural) and accident severity?
  4. Do weather conditions (e.g rain, snow, clear) affect accident frequency?

- Geographic and temporal patterns
  1. Are accidents more frequent in certain geographic areas (e.g urban vs rural)
  2. Do accidents occur more frequently during a certain month(s) or season(s)?
  3. Are there any temporal patterns in accident frequency (e.g more accidents durinf holidays)?
 
- Outliers and anomalies
  1. Are there any outliers in the data (e.g extremely high speeds, unusual accident types)?
  2. Are there any anomalies in the data (e.g sudden spikes in accident frequency)?
  3. Are there any data points that seem inconsisent or erroneous?

- Categorical Variable Analysis
  1. What is the distribution of accident types by road type?
  2. How do accident frequencies vary by day of week and time of day?
  3. Are there any differences in accident severity by vehicle type (e.g passenger car, truck, motorcycle)?
